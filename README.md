# sendgrid_promisie
Promsified wrapper that extends the sendgrid-nodejs package with helper functions to retrieve the list of templates

##
sendgrid-nodejs uses the request module, however I am more familiar with superagent and used superagent to wrap the GET request to match templates by name (case insensitive is by default);

### test cases and better instructions to come
